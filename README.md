<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

[![screenshot](screenshot.png)](https://devchallenges-recipe-page-master.vercel.app/)

A cool classic challenge.  
It was not easy to keep the html lightweight in order to replicate the layout.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), which I used to compile sass, prefix and minify CSS, generate sourcemaps and cache busting postfixes (which is really cool) and also minify the images. I now have a basic gulpfile that I can reuse for my next projects.

## Acknowledgements

<!-- This section should list any articles or add-ons/plugins that helps you to complete the project. This is optional but it will help you in the future. For exmpale -->

  I needed help in order to get the custom checkbox hover. Thank you ~ css selector !
